Integrated Project 2: Pau Capdevila, Sergi Busquets, Gerard Sánchez, Marcel Sánchez

This project presents the design and construction of a paper shredding machine (SHREDDER), developed entirely by the four students: Sergi, Pau, Gerard and Marcel within the framework of Integrated Project II course.  
The main objective was to build a functional system capable of shredding a sheet of paper, starting completely from scratch and without using any preassembled commercial components. 
The development included the design and fabrication of gears, the selection of a suitable motor for the required torque, the manufacturing of the cutting elements, and the creation of an extraction mechanism using a worm screw. Additionally, a fan was integrated to assist in ejecting shredded paper. 
The construction of the prototype required a combination of knowledge in mechanics, electronics, and industrial design, as well as careful management of resources and the fabrication process. The result is a compact and efficient machine capable of performing its main function successfully, demonstrating the feasibility of a fully custom-made project within an educational environment.
